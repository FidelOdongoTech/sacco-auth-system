# Stima Sacco Debt Management System - Authentication & Authorization

This is all about setting up a super secure and user-friendly authentication and authorization system for our Sacco Debt Management application. We're using some powerful tools here: **Keycloak** for handling all the identity magic, and **Angular** to build a slick frontend that ties it all together.

Think of this as your ready-to-go foundation for managing who can access what in your Sacco system. We've baked in security, role-based access, and a clean code structure so you can hit the ground running!

## Architecture

This system has two main players:

1.  **Keycloak Server**: This is our Identity and Access Management (IAM) powerhouse. It's where all your users, roles, and permissions live, making sure only the right people get in.
2.  **Angular Frontend**: This is the beautiful Single Page Application (SPA) that your users will interact with. It's smartly integrated with Keycloak to handle logins, show user info, and protect different parts of your app.

###  What's Inside? (Key Features)

I've packed this system with some awesome features to make your life easier and your app more secure:

*    **Rock-Solid Authentication**: We're using industry-standard OAuth 2.0 / OpenID Connect through Keycloak. That's a fancy way of saying it's super secure!
*    **Smart Role-Based Access Control**: We've set up three clear user roles right out of the box:
    *   **Admin**: The boss! Full system access, user management, and all the bells and whistles.
    *   **Debt Officer**: Your go-to for debt management, customer records, and reporting.
    *   **External Agent**: For those who need limited access, perhaps for external service integrations.
*    **Smooth JWT Token Management**: No need to worry about tokens expiring or refreshing. Keycloak handles all that automatically in the background.
*    **Protected Routes**: Our Angular app uses clever 


guards to make sure only users with the right roles can access specific parts of your application.
*    **Production-Ready Code**: We believe in clean, scalable code. This project is structured to be easy to understand, maintain, and extend, with proper error handling built-in.
*    **Responsive Design**: Your app will look great on any device, from a desktop monitor to a smartphone, thanks to its mobile-friendly design.
*    **Docker-Friendly**: Getting Keycloak up and running is a breeze with the included Docker Compose setup. Less hassle, more coding!

##  Ready to Dive In? (Quick Start)

Let's get this system up and running on your machine! Here's what you'll need and how to do it.

###  Prerequisites

Before I begin, make sure you have these installed:

*   **Docker and Docker Compose**: For effortlessly spinning up the Keycloak server.
*   **Node.js 18+ and npm**: The backbone for our Angular application.
*   **Angular CLI**: The command-line tool for building and managing Angular projects.

### 1. Fire Up Your Keycloak Server

 open your terminal and run this command:

```bash
# This command will get Keycloak running in the background, ready for action!
docker run -d --name keycloak \
  -p 8080:8080 \
  -e KEYCLOAK_ADMIN=admin \
  -e KEYCLOAK_ADMIN_PASSWORD=admin \
  quay.io/keycloak/keycloak:latest start-dev
```

### 2. A Little Keycloak Configuration Magic 

Now that Keycloak is running, let's set up our realm and client. This is a one-time setup!

1.  **Open your favorite web browser** and go to `http://localhost:8080`.
2.  **Log in to the admin console** using `admin` for both the username and password.
3.  **Create a brand new realm** (think of it as a dedicated space for your Sacco app) and name it `SaccoRealm`.
4.  **Create our three essential roles**: `Admin`, `Debt Officer`, and `External Agent`.
5.  **Set up a client** (this is how your Angular app talks to Keycloak) called `sacco-app` with these crucial settings:
    *   **Client Type**: `OpenID Connect`
    *   **Valid Redirect URIs**: `http://localhost:4200/*` (This tells Keycloak where to send users back after they log in)
    *   **Web Origins**: `http://localhost:4200` (This helps prevent pesky CORS issues)

### 3. Get Your Angular App Working

Almost there! Let's get the frontend ready.

First, navigate into the `sacco-auth-app` directory:

```bash
cd sacco-auth-app
```

Then, install all the necessary dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

And finally, you can either start the development server (great for testing and building):

```bash
# This will open your app in your browser, usually at http://localhost:4200
ng serve
```

Or, if you're ready to prepare it for deployment, build it for production:

```bash
# This creates optimized files in the 'dist' folder
ng build
```

##  Peeking Inside: Project Structure

We've kept things organized so you can easily find your way around. Here's a quick map of the project:

```

##  Security 

We've put a lot of thought into making this system secure and robust. Here's how it works under the hood:

### The Authentication Flow (A Smooth Journey)

1.  **Initial App Load**: When someone opens your app, it first checks if they're already logged in.
2.  **Unauthenticated? No Problem!**: If they're not, the app gracefully redirects them to the Keycloak login page.
3.  **Your User Logs In**: They enter their credentials on the secure Keycloak page.
4.  **Token Handling (Automated!)**: Once logged in, Keycloak issues JWT (JSON Web Tokens). Our system automatically manages these tokens, including refreshing them when needed, so your users stay logged in without interruption.
5.  **Route Protection**: Our clever Angular guards step in here, ensuring that only users with the correct roles can access specific parts of the application.

### Smart Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

We've defined clear roles to manage access effectively:

| Role             | What They Can Do (Permissions)                                  |
| :--------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Admin**        | The ultimate power user! Full system access, user management, and all features. |
| **Debt Officer** | Focused on debt management, customer records, and reporting.    |
| **External Agent** | Limited access, primarily for integrating with external services. |

### Token Management (Behind the Scenes)

*   **Automatic Refresh**: Your users won't even notice! Tokens are automatically refreshed before they expire, providing a seamless experience.
*   **Secure Storage**: Tokens are handled securely by the Keycloak Angular adapter, keeping them safe from prying eyes.
*   **HTTP Interceptor**: This is a neat trick! It automatically adds the necessary Bearer token to all your API requests, so you don't have to manually add it every time.
*   **Proper Logout Handling**: When a user logs out, we ensure all tokens and sessions are properly cleaned up, leaving no traces behind.

##  A Look at the User Interface

We've designed the UI to be clean, intuitive, and user-friendly.

### Login Page

*   A clean, professional design that guides users to log in.
*   Seamless integration with Keycloak, so the actual login happens securely on the Keycloak server.
*   Includes loading states and basic error handling for a better user experience.

### Dashboard

*   Your central hub after logging in.
*   Clearly displays user profile information (like name and email).
*   Features are shown or hidden based on the user's assigned roles.
*   Quick action buttons make it easy to jump to different sections.
*   Designed to be responsive, looking good on any screen size.

### Unauthorized Page

*   A clear and friendly message explaining why access was denied.
*   Provides information about the current user and their roles, which can be helpful for troubleshooting.
*   Offers navigation options, like going back to the dashboard or logging out.

## Development

Want to extend this project? Here are some common development tasks.

### Adding New Routes 

If you want to add a new page or feature that requires specific roles, it's super straightforward. Just update your `app.routes.ts` file like this:

```typescript
// In app.routes.ts
{
  path: 'new-feature',
  loadComponent: () => import('./components/new-feature/new-feature.component').then(m => m.NewFeatureComponent),
  canActivate: [RoleGuard], // Make sure to use our RoleGuard here!
  data: { roles: ['Admin'] } // Only Admins can see this page! You can add multiple roles too.
}
```

### Building Role-Protected Components

Inside your Angular components, you can easily show or hide content based on the user's roles. Our `AuthService` makes this a breeze:

```typescript
// In your component's TypeScript file
constructor(public authService: AuthService) { // Inject the AuthService }

// In your component's HTML template
<div *ngIf="authService.isAdmin()">
  <p>Welcome, Admin! This content is just for you.</p>
</div>

<button *ngIf="authService.isDebtOfficer()" (click)="doSomethingForDebtOfficer()">
  Manage Debts
</button>
```

### Seamless API Integration

Thanks to our HTTP interceptor, you don't have to manually add the JWT token to your API requests. It's all handled automatically!

```typescript
// In your service or component, when making an HTTP call
// No manual token handling needed here – our interceptor does the heavy lifting!
this.http.get('/api/protected-endpoint').subscribe(data => {
  console.log('Data from protected API:', data);
  // The JWT token was automatically included in the Authorization header!
});
```

##  Ready for Deployment

When you're ready to take your application live, here's how to prepare and deploy it.

### Production Build

First, create an optimized production build of your Angular app:

```bash
# This command builds your app and optimizes it for performance and size
ng build --configuration production

# After building, your optimized files will be in the 'dist/sacco-auth-app/browser/' folder.
# You can then serve these files using any standard web server.
```

### Docker Deployment

If you prefer to deploy using Docker, the `docker-compose.yml` file I provided is a great starting point for Keycloak. For your Angular app, you'd typically build it and then serve the static files using a lightweight web server like Nginx within a Docker container.

```bash
# This will spin up your Keycloak server in a Docker container
docker-compose up -d

# For your Angular app, you'll deploy the 'dist' folder to your preferred hosting service
# (like Netlify, Vercel, AWS S3, or an Nginx server in a Docker container).
```

### Environment Configuration 

It's common to have different settings for development, staging, and production environments. You'll primarily adjust the `src/app/keycloak.config.ts` file:

```typescript
// For Development (what we've been using locally)
export const keycloakConfig: KeycloakConfig = {
  url: 'http://localhost:8080', // Your local Keycloak URL
  realm: 'SaccoRealm',
  clientId: 'sacco-app'
};

// For Staging (a test environment before production)
// You'd replace 'staging-keycloak.your-domain.com' with your actual staging Keycloak URL
export const keycloakConfig: KeycloakConfig = {
  url: 'https://staging-keycloak.your-domain.com',
  realm: 'SaccoRealm',
  clientId: 'sacco-app'
};

// For Production (your live application!)
// Replace 'keycloak.your-domain.com' with your actual production Keycloak URL
export const keycloakConfig: KeycloakConfig = {
  url: 'https://keycloak.your-domain.com',
  realm: 'SaccoRealm',
  clientId: 'sacco-app'
};
```

## Testing

Testing is crucial! Here's how you can verify that your authentication system is working perfectly.

### Test Users (Your Practice Squad)

Remember those roles we created in Keycloak? Now's the time to create some users and assign them those roles. This lets you test different access levels.

| Username       | Password | Role             |
| :------------- | :------- | :--------------- |
| `admin_user`   | `password` | `Admin`          |
| `debt_officer` | `password` | `Debt Officer`   |
| `external_agent` | `password` | `External Agent` |

### Testing the Authentication Flow (The User's Journey)

1.  **Open your application** in the browser (e.g., `http://localhost:4200`).
2.  **You should be redirected** to the Keycloak login page. This is a good sign!
3.  **Log in** using one of your test user credentials (e.g., `admin_user` and `password`).
4.  **Success!** You should be redirected back to the application's dashboard.
5.  **Verify Role-Based Access**: Try navigating to different sections of the app. Do the Admin-only features show up for the Admin user? Does the Debt Officer see their specific tools? This is where you confirm your role guards are doing their job!

## Troubleshooting

Here are some common issues and how to tackle them.

### Common Roadblocks

*   **Keycloak Connection Error**: If your app can't talk to Keycloak:
    *   Double-check that Keycloak is actually running (you can use `docker ps` to see your running containers).
    *   Ensure Keycloak is accessible on `http://localhost:8080` (or whatever port you configured).
    *   Briefly check your firewall settings if you suspect they're blocking the connection.
    *   Verify that the realm name (`SaccoRealm`) and client ID (`sacco-app`) in your `keycloak.config.ts` match what you set up in Keycloak.

*   **CORS Issues (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)**: This happens when your browser blocks requests from your Angular app to Keycloak because they're on different 


domains/ports. To fix this:
    *   Make sure you added `http://localhost:4200` to the "Web Origins" field in your Keycloak client settings.
    *   Also, ensure `http://localhost:4200/*` is in the "Valid Redirect URIs".

*   **Token Expiry/Logout Glitches**: Our system handles token refresh automatically, but if you see issues:
    *   Check your browser console for any errors related to token refresh.
    *   Verify the session settings in your Keycloak realm.

### Debug Mode (When You Need to See Everything)

If you're scratching your head, enabling Keycloak's logging can be a lifesaver. Just tweak your `app.config.ts` file:

```typescript
initOptions: {
  onLoad: 'check-sso',
  enableLogging: true // Flip this to 'true' to see detailed Keycloak logs in your browser console!
}
```
